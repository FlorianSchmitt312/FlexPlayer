# FlexPlayer
This Project contains a Mediaplayer which is created with the Java FX framework.
For now the User is able to search his local file system for music files, play /stop /pause them with media control buttons and
change the volume of the chosen song with a slider. Furthermore their is a time slider which is capable of set the song to a specific point
in its Duration and the Mediaplayer plays it from there.

Future plans are to implement a list which you can populate with some songs and do stuff like "play random" or in a "play in a specific order".

If you want to compile the code you need the JavaFX11 SDK!
